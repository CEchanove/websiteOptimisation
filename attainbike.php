                <p>The Attain Performance bike provides exceptional comfort in the saddle due to its perfectly dialled geometry,
                    lightweight performance from its advanced aluminium frame and incredible braking performance with
                    the new disc brake system. It also adds a reassuring dose of all-weather reliability for races or
                    training rides, allowing you to concentrate on your performance without worrying about wet roads.
